# Image-Processing-on-MATLAB
Self experimentation projects of image processing

# (1) Car Number Plate Filter
1. Convert image to grayscale
2. Implement manual thresolding at 200
3. Use median filter to remove pepper noise
4. Apply morphological filter to remove unwanted edges

 Scope of improvement : 

@2, using an auto threshold selector like OSTU thresholding

@4, using better edge removal filter
